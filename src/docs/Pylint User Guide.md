# Pylint User Guide

Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.

## Installation

You can install Pylint via pip:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

## Basic Usage

To use Pylint, navigate to the directory containing your Python file(s) in the terminal and run:

```bash
pylint my_file.py
```

Replace `my_file.py` with the name of your Python file. Pylint will then print a report that includes issues it found, a score for your code, and more.

## Understanding the Output

Pylint’s output consists of a list of issues it found in your code, along with a final score. Each issue includes:

- The type of the issue (convention, refactor, warning, or error).
- A message ID (like C0114).
- The line and column where the issue was found.
- A description of the issue.

The final score is out of 10 and is based on the number and severity of the issues found.

## Customization

Pylint is highly customizable. You can enable or disable specific checks, change the scoring system, and more. This is done using a configuration file (`.pylintrc`).

To generate a default configuration file, run:

```bash
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
```

You can then open `.pylintrc` in a text editor and change the settings as desired.

## Ignoring Issues

If there are specific issues or files you want Pylint to ignore, you can use the `# pylint: disable=some-message`,another-message comment. Replace `some-message,another-message` with the message IDs of the issues you want to ignore.

For example, to ignore the “line too long” message, you can do:

```python
# pylint: disable=line-too-long
```

## Conclusion

Pylint is a powerful tool that can help you write better Python code. By using it regularly, you can catch and fix issues before they become problems, and ensure your code adheres to the coding standards you or your team have set.
